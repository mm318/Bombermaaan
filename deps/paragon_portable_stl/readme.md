# Paragon Portable STL

**Paragon Portable STL (PSTL)** is a lightweight, modular implementation of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL), designed for embedded and cross-platform environments.

---

## Key Features  

- **Portability and Adaptability**  
  PSTL works seamlessly across platforms, from bare-metal systems to OS-based environments, ensuring predictable behavior and minimal platform-specific dependencies.  

- **Flexible Error Handling**  
  PSTL provides robust error-handling mechanisms with support for both exception-based and exception-free modes, catering to diverse project requirements.  

- **Precision Memory Control**  
  Optimized memory management ensures stability and performance, even in the most constrained environments.  

- **Header-Only Implementation**  
  A header-only design reduces build complexity and simplifies integration, especially in resource-constrained projects.  

- **Selective Component Inclusion**  
  Include only the components you need, reducing binary size and compilation overhead for optimized performance.  

- **Ease of Migration**  
  PSTL can be used alongside existing STL implementations, allowing gradual adoption without disrupting legacy codebases.
